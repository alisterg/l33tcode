# Workflow

1. Choose a problem from https://leetcode.com/studyplan/leetcode-75/
2. Create a Source and Test file for the problem
3. Solve the problem
   - Run tests using `swift test`
4. Sumbit problem on leetcode

# Getting setup

To use the testing framework, I had to install the 6.0 beta swift toolchain from
https://www.swift.org/install/macos/

If Swift isn't using the correct version run `export TOOLCHAINS=swift`
